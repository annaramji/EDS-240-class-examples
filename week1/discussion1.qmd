# Week 1 Discussion:
**Practicing cleaning, wrangling, annotating**

## Load packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(usdata)
library(here)
```

## Read in data
```{r}
fracking_raw <- read_csv(here("week1", "data", "fracking.csv"))

```

## Preliminary exploration
```{r}
head(fracking_raw)

```
Yuck! super messy. We have inconsistent CamelCase in the column names, inaccurate datatypes for data stored in columns (stored as characters, not datetime objects; some numbers stored as characters). 


# Cleaning


```{r}
fracking_cleaned <- fracking_raw |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |>  # tidying column names
  


```
