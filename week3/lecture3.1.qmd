# Week 3 Class Examples

## Lecture 3.1: Choosing the right graphic form

### We understand complex numbers better when they’re represented visually

“Exams will have a total of 137 points rather than the usual 100. This scoring system has no effect on the grade you get in the course, but it seems to make you happier”

-Richard H. Thaler, economist & professor

Early years: exam graded 0 - 100 with an average score of 72 points = lots of complaints

Later years: exam graded 0 - 137 with an average score of 96 points = very few complaints

**Vision is our most well-developed sense**

-   Mapping data into visual properties is powerful

Mapping: how values of variables of interest are represented by visuals (height of bar, etc.)

### **How do you choose the right graphic form to represent your data?**

“If I had the answer to that, I’d be rich by now…I have no idea, but I can give you some clues to make your own choices based on what we know about why and how visualization works” (Albert Cairo, The Truthful Art)

### **Exercise: Map data to visual properties**

Let’s say **you want to compare unemployment rates of 5 countries**: A, B, C, D, E (the actual values here are not important).

How would you **map the unemployment rates to visual properties** in a way that enables your readers to accurately compare values without having to read all the numbers?

-   map onto base map of the world, color fill or shade relevant countries with rates

-   pop-out graphic of people (10 ppl shapes), shaded in to unemployment rate

-   bar graph, ordered from lowest to highest, easily compare a, b, c, d, e

class answer:

-   length or height (bar, lolipop charts)

-   position (distance along some range)

-   area (bubble size)

-   angle/area (pie charts)

-   hue and shade

### "Hierarchy of elementary perceptual tasks"

-   William S. Cleveland & Robert McGill (1984) **Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation, and Application to the Development of Graphical Methods**, *Journal of the American Statistical Association*, 79:387, 531-554, DOI: [10.1080/01621459.1984.10478080](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1984.10478080)

-   a viewer performs one or more of these mental-visual tasks (judging position, perceiving angles / areas, etc.) to extract the values of real variables represented on most graphs

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   successful charts are constructed based on elementary tasks “as high in the hierarchy as possible”

![](figs/cairo-elementary-visual-perception.png){width="512"}

Both differ by a factor of 7

![](figs/seven-factor-diff.png)

-   harder to tell in the circle

### **Caveats to the hierarchy** 

1\. Cleveland & McGill only considered *statistical charts*. What about data maps, for example, that rely on area / shading / hue, which fall lower on the hierarchy?

Example:

**Lower scale methods can be appropriate when the goal is to reveal general patterns.** For example, a choropleth map displays divided geographical areas / regions, which are colored in relation to a numeric variable. <https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/slides/week3.1-choosing-graphic-forms-slides.html#/caveats1.1>

-   precipitation by county, brown-white-blue

2.  No method of choosing a graphic form is perfect! It’s important to think critically about your graphic’s purpose and how best to represent your data to serve that purpose.

Example:

Consider how you might display the same data in the following Sankey diagram, which depicts the flow of refugees in 2022, using graph types from the top of Cleveland & McGill’s hierarchy. **What is the purpose of this chart?** <https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/slides/week3.1-choosing-graphic-forms-slides.html#/caveats2.1>

### **Tips for choosing the right graphic form**

1.  **Think about the task(s) you want to enable or message(s) you want to convey.** For example, do you want to compare, see change or flow, reveal relationships or connections, envision temporal or spatial patterns.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2.  **Consider the number of variables and the number of data points, as well as the data types you’re working with.** For example, do you have several vs. many data points? How many categorical and/or numeric variables? Are your variables ordered or not ordered? Data types can dictate which graphical form is appropriate.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  **Try different graphic forms,** especially if you have more than one task to enable or message to convey.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
4.  **Arrange the components of the graphic** to make it as easy as possible to extract meaning from your graphic quickly.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
5.  **Test the outcomes of your graphic on others,** particularly on those who are representative of the audience you are trying to reach.

### **1. What task(s) to enable / message(s) to convey**

<https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/slides/week3.1-choosing-graphic-forms-slides.html#/chart-selectors>

![](images/clipboard-3034863021.png){width="594"}

![](images/clipboard-173877662.png){width="599"}

### **2. Number of variables & data points, data types**

**Continuous variables:** temperature (10.6°C, 14.9°C, 8.1°C), rainfall (1.7”, 3.3”, 9.4”)

**Discrete variables:** \# of species counted in a region (1, 4, 6), a county’s population size (1,578, 10,324, 540,013)

**Nominal variables:** gender identity (cisgender, transgender, non-binary), species (dog, cat, bird), land use (residential, parks, agriculture)

**Ordinal variables:** income level (low / middle / high), satisfaction level (unsatisfied, neutral, satisfied)

**Binary:** penguin sex (male / female), habitat type (shade / sun)

### **3. Try different graphic forms**

Recall our choropleth map from earlier, which displays total precipitation by US county. What if we want to compare precipitation between CA counties? Choosing a graphical form from the top of the hierarchy (e.g. bar chart) may be more effective.

### **4. Arrange components of the graphic**

Example: How does the influence of **in-theater advertising** change across generations?

![](images/clipboard-2640523695.png){width="569"}

-   influence decreases in older generations

-   intuitively want to read it from older to younger, flipped here

Updated:

![](images/clipboard-1287247787.png)

-   direct comparisons within each category

-   depends on what the goal of your plot is

**Let’s say we’re interested in:**

a.  changes in the amount spent on Social Security relative to other major spending categories over time (2012-2015)?

b.  the amount of money spent on Social Security over time (2012-2015)? \[[slide](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/slides/week3.1-choosing-graphic-forms-slides.html#/fed-spending2)\]

![](images/clipboard-3198616858.png)

see slides for [heatmap example](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/slides/week3.1-choosing-graphic-forms-slides.html#/internet2)

### **5. Test the outcomes of your graphic on others**

![](images/clipboard-2106684503.png){width="591"}

What is the take home message of this graphic?

-   far more civilian deaths than coalition deaths

-   US involvement heavy, deaths spike at key events

-   biggest killer: executions

What is effective? What is confusing?

-   annoying that biggest killers aren't ranked by size

-   so much going on

-   we wish they had put the US ground troups overlay on the blood

Baseline at the *top* is clear, suggesting that bars are *falling* from it. Clear metaphor (dripping blood).

Example: classic florida gun viz

![](images/clipboard-3407984365.png){width="348"}

-   What is the take home message of this graphic?

    -   take home message is that murders decrease (false)

-   What is effective? What is confusing?

    -   inverted plot causes misleading visualization

    -   deaths actually spike after stand your ground law, not fall

Eyes are drawn to baseline at the *bottom*, on top of which data are sitting. Headline indicates *rise* but visually represented by *falling*. Thick black line makes white area stand out over red (data).

Business Insider [published](https://www.businessinsider.com/gun-deaths-in-florida-increased-with-stand-your-ground-2014-2) an updated graphic (originally designed by Reuters), which was submitted by a reader that, **“more clearly shows that gun deaths increased between 2005 and 2007 by flipping the y-axis”**:

**Critiquing a data visualization:**

1.  Identify the primary and secondary insights that the graphic is trying to convey.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2.  Identify elementary perceptual tasks (e.g. comparing lengths, angles) and what is confusing or difficult to do.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  Identify if it’s possible (*and* if it makes sense) to use more effective elementary perceptual tasks for the primary and secondary insights

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
4.  Identify points of confusion and decide how those could be addressed (e.g. a different graphic form, rearranging components, including an introduction graph, better annotation)
